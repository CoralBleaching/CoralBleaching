### Hi, I'm Renato de Oliveira

I'm majoring in Computational Mathematics at the end of 2022. As such, I have good algorithmic, back-end and numerical skills. 

I'm most interested in data analysis and mathematical modeling, but I also practice development in general. 

Right now I'm learning data mining, ML algorithms and database management. 

I program mainly in C++ and C for efficiency and Python for speed of development. I'd like to learn Rust and Julia in the future.
