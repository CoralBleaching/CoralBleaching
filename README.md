### Hi, I'm Renato de Oliveira

I'm a B.Sc in Computational Mathematics. As such, I have good algorithmic, back-end and numerical skills. 

I'm most interested in data analysis and mathematical modeling, but I also practice development in general. 

I'm also interested in opportunities to program with hip upcoming languages like Go and Rust.

Right now I'm honing my skills in data mining and ML algorithms. 

I program mainly in C++ and C for efficiency and Python for speed of development. I'd like to learn Rust and Julia in the future.
